# Object Detection AI Model

Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video. This guide provides a detailed overview of building an object detection AI model using OpenCV, OS, and Matplotlib. We'll walk through the setup, implementation, and visualization of the object detection process.

> **To run This:** you have to install files in your system in jupyter.

## Used Libraries

To implement an object detection model, you use the following libraries:

* **OpenCV** : For image and video processing.
* **OS** : For file and directory management.
* **Matplotlib** : For visualizing the results.

## Future Updates

live object detection which detects object using external camers or webcam.
